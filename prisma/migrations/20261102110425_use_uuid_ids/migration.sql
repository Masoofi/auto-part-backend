  - The primary key for the `Category` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The primary key for the `Product` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `Category` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `Product` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `categoryId` on the `Product` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
